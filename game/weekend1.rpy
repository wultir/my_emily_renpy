    em "It's so sad. She was only 9.."
    em "You know my dad and James are like close friends"
    em "But I think that's the biggest reason he's so nice to me. I think he sees Lisa in me because we were best friends"

    j "Yeah but I only bought a cheap trailer to live in with the money I got from the army. I saved the rest"
